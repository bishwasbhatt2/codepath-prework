## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I was already taking a course called Web Development by Angela in Udemy before knowing about this summer program. So, I tried using some skills I learned there.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[A simple but stupid mistake/challenge I encountered while creating this submission was using the DOM function, I kept using the word ID instead of Id which made me look at my code for hours and hours. I still wasn't able to fix it until the end where I decided to read the documentation on the DOM functions and then I noticed the small error and fixed it. Afterwards, my sound system was working again.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[As much as this project was fun to do. I didn't quite understand some aspects of web development such as DOM, some of javascript. So, I am willing to do some more research after this submission, and hopefully get to participate in the summer program where I can learn from codepath. My goal for this year is to fully understand the fundamentals of web development (the front end and back-end.)]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[One thing I noticed at the end of the project was that my bootstrap implmentation was messing with my css code. I would usually fix this, but because of me being packed between my current job and college classes. I didn't get any time to do so.]
